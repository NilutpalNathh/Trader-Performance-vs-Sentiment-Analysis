Rule 1: Slow Down When the Market Is Scared
When the market is in Extreme Fear, things feel chaotic. Prices move fast. Setups fail more often. What worked yesterday suddenly stops working. It’s uncomfortable — and honestly, a bit stressful.
The data shows it clearly: bigger swings, lower win rates, more unpredictability.
So this is not the time to be brave.
It’s the time to be careful.
When fear is high, your job isn’t to “win big.” Your job is to protect yourself. Reduce your leverage then Trade smaller. Be selective. If a setup isn’t clear, skip it. There will always be another opportunity.
Think of it like this when the weather turns into a storm, you don’t run faster into it. You wait, you protect yourself, and you move carefully.
Markets are the same.
The traders who survive Extreme Fear are the ones who respect it. They don’t fight volatility — they manage it. And that’s what keeps them consistent in the long run.
 Rule 2: Apply Controlled Aggression During Extreme Greed
The analysis shows that Extreme Greed periods deliver the strongest overall performance in the dataset. During these phases, both average PnL and win rates are higher compared to other sentiment regimes. This suggests that strong bullish momentum tends to support more profitable trading outcomes.
In such conditions, traders may consider moderately increasing exposure or position sizes to take advantage of favorable market trends. However, this does not mean ignoring risk management. Even strong markets can reverse unexpectedly. Any increase in exposure should be deliberate and rule-based, not driven by overconfidence or emotion.
The objective is to capitalize on momentum while maintaining disciplined risk control to protect against sudden market shifts.

Rule 3: Avoid Overtrading During High-Emotion Markets
The analysis indicates that trading activity tends to increase during Fear regimes. While heightened volatility can create more trading opportunities, it also increases the risk of impulsive and emotionally driven decisions.
During emotionally charged market conditions, traders should be especially cautious about overtrading. Acting on every short-term price movement can reduce consistency and increase unnecessary risk exposure. Instead, focusing on high-quality setups and sticking to predefined trading rules can help maintain discipline.
In fear-driven markets, emotional control becomes just as important as technical skill. A structured and patient approach can prevent avoidable losses and support more stable performance over time.


1: Market Sentiment Has a Clear Impact on Performance
The analysis shows that trader performance changes significantly depending on market sentiment. When the market is in Extreme Greed, traders achieve the highest average profit per trade and the strongest win rate, indicating that positive momentum supports better outcomes. During Fear periods, total profit is actually higher, mainly because traders are more active and execute more trades. However, in Extreme Fear conditions, performance weakens as win rates decline and volatility rises. This makes profits less stable and increases overall risk. In short, market mood plays a clear role in shaping both profitability and trading consistency.
 2: Risk Becomes Much Higher During Extreme Fear

Extreme Fear periods are associated with the highest level of risk in the dataset. During these days, the volatility of PnL is significantly higher, meaning that profits and losses fluctuate more sharply compared to other sentiment regimes. In simple terms, trading outcomes become less predictable when markets are driven by panic or uncertainty. While there may be opportunities for larger gains, the potential for larger losses also increases. This creates a more unstable trading environment. In contrast, Neutral market conditions show much lower volatility, indicating more stable and controlled performance, although profit potential may be more limited. Overall, fear-driven markets demand stronger risk management, greater discipline, and more cautious decision-making from traders.
 3: Traders Slightly Favor Selling Positions
The analysis shows that across most market sentiment categories, SELL trades slightly outnumber BUY trades. Although the difference is not very large, it appears consistently in different market conditions. This suggests that traders may lean toward more defensive or short-term strategies rather than aggressively buying, even during Greed periods. Instead of fully committing to bullish momentum, many traders seem to maintain a cautious approach. This pattern reflects a general preference for managing risk carefully and possibly capitalizing on short-term price movements rather than relying entirely on long-term upward trends.

4: Trading Activity Increases During Fear
The analysis indicates that trading activity increases noticeably during Fear periods. When markets become more volatile and uncertain, traders tend to place more trades, likely reacting to rapid price movements and short-term opportunities. Unstable conditions seem to encourage higher participation and quicker decision-making. However, this rise in activity does not necessarily improve overall performance. In fact, win rates during Fear periods are not the highest, which suggests that trading more frequently does not always lead to better results. This highlights the importance of maintaining discipline and sticking to well-defined strategies, especially in emotionally driven market environments.
